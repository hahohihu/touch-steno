# touch-steno
touch-steno emulates steno keyboards on multi-touch screens. Use it to see if you like steno at no extra cost (if you already own a tablet/laptop with touchscreen/etc).

## Setup
1. You'll need to install [todo kb server]() on your desktop - touch-steno sends inputs to it over wifi.
2. Go to the [touch-steno webapp]() and follow the instructions there.
